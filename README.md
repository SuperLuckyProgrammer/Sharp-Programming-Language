# Basic Functions:
I understand, you want to learn what are the Basic Functions that are available right now, I will explain.

1. print
  The print function is a must-know function. It outputs a value onto the screen.<br>
  <h2>Syntax:</h2><br>
  print <- [what_to_print]<br>
  <h2>Example:</h2><br>
  print <- "Hello world"<br><br><br><br>
2. input
  The input function is also a must-know function. It asks the user for an input, then gets the value and assigns it to a variable<br>
  <h2>Syntax:</h2><br>
  input -> [what_to_input] [variable]<br>
  <h2>Example:</h2><br>
  input -> "What is your name? " [name]<br><br><br><br>
3. exit
  The exit function is a function that makes you literally exit the program.<br>
  <h2>Syntax:</h2><br>
  exit<br>
  <h2>Example:</h2><br>
  exit<br><br><br><br>
4. system
  The system function is a function that runs a command in the terminal.<br>
  <h2>Syntax:</h2><br>
  system [command]<br>
  <h2>Example:</h2><br>
