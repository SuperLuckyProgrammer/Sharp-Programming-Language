I understand, you want to learn what are the Basic Functions that are available right now, I will explain.

1. print
  The print function is a must-know function. It outputs a value onto the screen.
  Syntax:

  Example:

  Example:

3. exit
  The exit function is a function that makes you literally exit the program.
  Syntax:
  exit
  Example:

  The system function is a function that runs a command in the terminal.
  Syntax:
  system [command]
